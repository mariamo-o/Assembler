# Python Assembler
# Project Overview
The Assembler project is a Python-based tool that translates assembly language code into machine code. This project was developed as part of our coursework to gain a deeper understanding of how assembly code interacts with computer hardware at a low level.

# Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python
# Features
- **Assembly to Machine Code Translation:** Converts assembly language instructions into corresponding machine code.
- **Error Detection:** Identifies and reports errors in assembly code syntax.
- **User Interface:** Command-line interface for entering and processing assembly code.
# Usage
- **Input Assembly Code:** Enter your assembly code in the input file.
- **Run Assembler:** Execute the script to generate machine code output.
